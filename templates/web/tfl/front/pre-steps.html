    <strong>
        All issues reported on Streetcare continue to be monitored by our teams at
        Transport for London. We are not able to carry out all of our normal
        maintenance works at the moment but we are working hard to deal with all
        safety critical issues.
    </strong>
    <br>
    We will continue to serve you the best that we can but urge everyone not to
    make journeys unless absolutely necessary.
    <br>
    We will be able to give you a further update on this by the end of May.
